# php_project(still in progress)

When it is finished it will be a forum about nature, so far not all features have been added(such as live chat system),
but users are able to create accounts, make posts, write comments. The project is being made using MVC.

To launch the project you will need to open it in PHP Storm and create a Built-in PHP Web Server and then launched in any browser
using localhost.
